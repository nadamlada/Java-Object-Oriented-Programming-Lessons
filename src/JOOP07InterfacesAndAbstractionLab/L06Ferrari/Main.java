/*
Model an application that contains a class Ferrari and an interface. Your task is simple, you have a car - Ferrari, its model is "488-Spider" and it has a driver. Your Ferrari should have the functionality to use brakes and push the gas pedal. When the brakes are pushed down print "Brakes!", and when the gas pedal is pushed down - "brum-brum-brum-brrrrr". As you may have guessed this functionality is typical for all cars, so you should implement an interface to describe it.
